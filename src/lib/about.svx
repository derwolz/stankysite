 King Stanky
=================



There comes a time in every man's life where he must ask of his own worth. What value does he provide to himself and his loved ones? Is a man a victim of circumstances or is he self made?

In all, my thoughts on the matter are meaningless. You, dear reader have already come to your own conclusions after all, despite your best intentions to listen.  

So what of it then? This section, your time spent trying to learn of a literal nobody on this distant corner of the internet. Why do you treat your own life so frivolously? Some vain hope to live vicariously through someone you don't know? Aspiring to be something you want, but refuse to put the time into being?

To you it is given to act. There is no cavalry coming to save you, because you are the cavalry.
